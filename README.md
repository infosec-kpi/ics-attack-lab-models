# ICS Attack Graph Models and SAT/SMT Analysis

This repository contains graph-based models of cyberattacks on Industrial Control Systems (ICS), as well as scripts and methodology for analyzing system vulnerabilities using SAT/SMT solvers (Z3).

The models and methods are based on the research article:

> **"Attack Models for Industrial Control System Elements Based on a Graph Approach and Countermeasures"**  
> Oleksii Novikov, Iryna Stopochkina, Andrii Voitsekhovskyi, Mykola Ilin  
> National Technical University of Ukraine "Igor Sikorsky KPI", 2025
